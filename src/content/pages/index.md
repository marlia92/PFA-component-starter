          title="Bob Ross" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn't</a> know you
          had so much power, did you? Let me tell you what I've got going on up
          here. Don't be afraid of this big brush.


          > If there's a secret to anything, it's practice. Create that little
          fuzzy look. Hit it, and get away from it. So many things you can
          create.

          **Just** let it *work* around <u>and</u> play. <s>That's</s>
          <sub>the</sub> fun part of this whole technique. We're
          <sup>ready</sup> to get <a href="https://bobrosslipsum.net/"
          title="Ross Bobb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serious</a> with
          this. Enough of that.


          Don't just cover it all up -- leave these spots! We want this
          swirling, churning actions here. We don't want to overload it, just a
          little bit. Let your imagination wander around while you're doing
          these things.
