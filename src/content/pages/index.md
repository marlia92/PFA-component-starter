    heading: 'Investment in Pasifika festivals '
    subtext: >-
      Pasifika Festivals Aotearoa Incorporated Society (PFA Inc) was established
      in April 2024 as an outcome of the Ministry for Culture and Heritage (MCH)
      investment in Pasifika festivals through Creative New Zealand (CNZ). The
      investment emphasised the collective voice, coordination, and leadership
      required to strengthen the Pasifika festival ecosystem across Aotearoa.


      PFA Inc is a national, intergenerational collective of Pacific festivals —
      weaving together culture, community, and celebration. Our mission is to
      hold the vā between festivals, sharing resources, knowledge, and advocacy
      to grow Pacific capability, visibility, and resilience.
